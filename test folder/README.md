**Day 1** <img src="/Images/Alien 1.png" alt="Alien 1"/>

 - [x] Select a topic  - UFO Sightings 

- [x] Find a data set 

	[Century of data](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/metadata) & [April sightings 2020](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxe202004.html) 

- [x] Find inspiration 

	Do certain areas have higher concentrations of sightings?
	
	What is the most common shape of a sighting?
	
	What is the average duration of a sighting?
	
	Is there a higher concentration of sightings at night?

- [x] Sketch ideal visuals 

	[Bubble Map](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/bubblemap.html) to view concentration levels of sightings (Leaflet)
	
			
	[Lollipop Chart](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/lollipop.html) to view the most common shapes of a sighting 
		
		
	[Violin Chart](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/violin.html) to view the bins of duration for a sighting
	
		
		
	[Word Cloud](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/wordcloud_size.html) of submitted summaries for each sighting (D3)
	
		
	
- [x] Create a 1 page proposal - Located Below 
	

**Day 2** :alien: :alien:

- [x] Brief articulation of chosen topic and rationale 

	UFO sightings were chosen as our data set in honor of Halloween and all of the spooky mysteries UFO data has to offer. In creating the visualizations for this data we hope to gather unearthly insights into these occurrences.

- [x] A link to data set and screenshot of the metadata if it exists 

	[Century of data](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/metadata)
	
	[April sightings 2020](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxe202004.html) 
	
	<img src="/Images/screenshot_metadata.png" alt="Screenshot of metadata"/>   
	
	
- [x] Screenshots of relevant, inspiring visualizations:

<img src="/Images/Bubble Map ex.png" alt="Bubble Map ex"/>   <img src="/Images/Violin Chart ex.png" alt="Violin Chart ex"/>           
<img src="/Images/Lollipop Chart ex.png" alt="Lollipop Chart ex"/>   <img src="/Images/Word Chart ex.png" alt="Word Chart ex"/>




- [x] A sketch of the final design 

Main web page with navbar (possible separate pages for charts as well)

Main page with a filter for selected dates or locations with a collective chart change 

	Main Chart on top of screen - Map of locations (Bubble)
	
		Secondary chart below or beside Bubble: Amchart pictorial 
		
			(This chart will show how many sightings per period selected)
			
	Filtered charts per date or location: 	
	
		Violin, Lollipop, Word Cloud 

- [x] Link to the primary [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JuliaAlsop/Project-2.git)

	
- [x] Project description:

Collection of data and layout of project design: Group Effort 

Project Presentation: Group Effort

Website design layout: Group Effort

Data chart visualization design: Group Effort

In order to provide our users an interactive representation of data, we are implementing various techniques for user ease including: 

-The use of a bubble map to pinpoint direct locations of occurrences

-A lollipop chart to clearly visualize the different amount of shapes seen

-A word cloud in order to see the most reported words used to describe the UFO’s

-A violin chart to visualize any time period correlations or groupings 

-And finally an amchart to visualize the data with a new template never used before


(give link in presentation for people to follow along and try themselves)

Additional JS Library will be [amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/javascript-maps/)
